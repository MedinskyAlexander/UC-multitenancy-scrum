## ðŸ”„ Next Steps Required

### 1. Import All User Stories as GitHub Issues

The complete set of 82+ user stories is prepared in `github-setup/github-issues.md`. These need to be imported into GitHub Issues. Each story includes:
- Proper labels (epic, component, story points, priority, phase)
- Complete acceptance criteria  
- User story format (As a... I want... So that...)
- Epic assignment and milestone mapping

**Import Options:**
- Manual creation via GitHub CLI (recommended for accuracy)
- GitHub API automation script  
- Third-party import tools

### 2. Create GitHub Project Board

A Scrum project board is needed with columns:
- **Backlog** - All user stories waiting to be prioritized
- **Ready** - Stories ready for sprint planning  
- **In Progress** - Currently being worked on
- **In Review** - Code review and testing
- **Done** - Completed stories

**Note:** Requires additional GitHub authentication scopes (project, read:project)

### 3. Configure Team Access

Add team members to the repository with appropriate permissions:
- **Maintainer:** Tech Lead, Scrum Master
- **Write:** Development team members  
- **Read:** Stakeholders and observers

### 4. Set up GitHub Actions (Optional)

Consider automation for:
- Issue templates for consistent story creation
- Automated labeling based on issue content
- Sprint milestone automation
- Progress reporting and metrics
