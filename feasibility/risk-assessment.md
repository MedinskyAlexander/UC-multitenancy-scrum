       TenantContext.setTenant(tenantA);
       Player playerA = playerService.createPlayer(request);
       
       // Switch to tenant B context  
       TenantContext.setTenant(tenantB);
       
       // Verify tenant B cannot access tenant A's data
       assertThrows(PlayerNotFoundException.class, 
           () -> playerService.getPlayerById(playerA.getId()));
   }
   ```

2. **Automated Security Scanning**
