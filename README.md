# UG Casino Multitenancy Documentation

This directory contains comprehensive documentation for implementing multitenancy in the UG Casino platform to enable cost-effective whitelabeling.

## Document Structure

### üìã Feasibility Analysis
- **[Feasibility Report](feasibility/multitenancy-feasibility-report.md)** - Complete analysis of implementation approaches and recommendations
- **[Business Case](feasibility/business-case.md)** - ROI analysis and business justification
- **[Risk Assessment](feasibility/risk-assessment.md)** - Technical and business risks with mitigation strategies

### üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture  
- **[Architecture Overview](architecture/technical-architecture.md)** - Complete technical design and specifications
- **[Data Model](architecture/data-model.md)** - Database schema and entity relationships
- **[Security Design](architecture/security-architecture.md)** - Multi-tenant security patterns and isolation
- **[API Specifications](architecture/api-specifications.md)** - REST and GraphQL API designs

### üöÄ Implementation Guide
- **[Implementation Plan](implementation/implementation-plan.md)** - Phase-by-phase development roadmap  
- **[Migration Strategy](implementation/migration-strategy.md)** - Data migration and rollback procedures
- **[Development Guide](implementation/development-guide.md)** - Developer instructions and code standards
- **[Testing Strategy](implementation/testing-strategy.md)** - Test plans and validation procedures

## Quick Start

1. **Review Feasibility** - Start with the [Feasibility Report](feasibility/multitenancy-feasibility-report.md)
2. **Understand Architecture** - Read the [Technical Architecture](architecture/technical-architecture.md)  
3. **Plan Implementation** - Follow the [Implementation Plan](implementation/implementation-plan.md)

## Key Decisions

- **Approach**: Domain-based tenant isolation with shared database
- **Timeline**: 6-8 months development (140-180 developer days)
- **Cost**: Medium complexity, high ROI for whitelabeling
- **Strategy**: Phased rollout with comprehensive testing
